                                <li><b>Email:</b> A robust tool for asynchronous communication, email serves as a reliable log of exchanges, perfect for in-depth discussions and deliberation. However, it might not be ideal for side conversations or quick agreement due to its sequential nature.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li><b>Chat:</b> This medium supports side conversations and offers quick answers without the need for participants to switch contexts. However, longer text-based exchanges can get tedious, and without regular summaries or overviews, chat threads can quickly become messy and difficult to follow.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li><b>Video Conferencing:</b> Providing a platform for non-verbal cues ("Jenny seems tired today - letâ€™s cheer her up"), video conferencing can foster a more personal interaction that requires and promotes focus (multitasking becomes more noticeable and thus less likely). However, it does require a strong network connection and implies a level of intimacy due to the sharing of personal space and appearance.</li>

                            <p><b>The 'Mic (or Camera) On' technique</b> can help foster a sense of presence in a meeting. While it may seem counterintuitive, having your microphone or camera on can discourage distractions and help participants feel more 'present'. It provides a sense of each participant's environment, further humanizing the virtual experience. However, if background noise becomes disruptive, politely request the participant to find a quieter location or mute their mic temporarily.</p>
                            <p><b>Ensure participants are aware that you may ask them questions directly</b> or call on them individually. This anticipation can keep attendees attentive and ready to engage.</p>
                            <p><b>Discourage multitasking</b> by explicitly stating it at the start of the meeting. Multitasking can detract from an individual's full engagement in the discussion.</p>
                            <p><b>Increase participant interaction by referencing their contributions:</b> "As John pointed out earlier..." and ask others to provide their perspectives. By doing this, you acknowledge their input and stimulate further discussion.</p>
                            <p><b>Regularly recap and summarize key points:</b> Let participants know you'll be doing this not because they're incapable of understanding, but because voice quality can sometimes diminish at key moments, or because it's challenging to remember every detail of a discussion. These intermediary "reminders" or summaries help keep everyone connected with the topic.</p>
                            <p><b>Preemptively explain your repetition</b>, saying something like, "I'll be repeating key points throughout this meeting. Not because you're incapable of understanding, but I'm aware it can be challenging to consistently hear everyone clearly and to recall every step of our discussion."</p>

Therefore, it's crucial to signal the conclusion of the meeting clearly and engagingly. To do so, you can ask each participant a closing question, which re-engages their attention and reinforces the takeaways from the discussion. Questions like:</p>
                        <p><i>"What agreement do you believe we've reached during this discussion?"</i></p>
                        <p><i>"How has this meeting benefited your work or enhanced your understanding?"</i></p>
                        <p> By asking these questions, you not only bring the meeting to a thoughtful close but also reinforce key points and agreements from the meeting. It allows for the final exchange of ideas and ensures everyone leaves the meeting with a clear understanding of the discussion and the next steps.</p>

                        <p> Preparation undeniably holds the key to a successful meeting. Turning up early not only allows for seamless meeting setup but also sets the stage for establishing a pleasant conversational tone (a friendly pre-meeting chat can be a perfect ice-breaker). Infusing a bit of novelty into your meetings with the introduction of new roles can distribute responsibilities, increase engagement, and add a fun element to proceedings. Skillful management of silence periods and fostering active participant involvement (such as mentioning their names) can create a more interactive environment.</p>
                        <p>By adopting these strategies, your virtual meetings can be better organized, more engaging, and ultimately more productive for everyone involved.</p>
